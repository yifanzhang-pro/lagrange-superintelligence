To transcend the thermodynamic saturation of terrestrial infrastructure, we propose the Lagrange Compute Systems (LCS), a phased migration of superintelligence to the dynamically stable Earth-Moon and Sun-Earth L4/L5 (Lagrange-4/5) Trojan points.

This architecture circumvents the station-keeping costs of unstable orbits, establishing a scalable off-world framework for low-latency inference and massive-scale foundation model training.
